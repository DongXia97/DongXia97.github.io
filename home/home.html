After Typography & Interaction class I went to the cafeteria in the University Center to get dinner and saw a bunch of interesting posters. When I left the school, I walked from E 14th St. to Union Square subway station and took the R line home. It usually takes about 25 minutes. I live at 29-22 Northern Blvd, Long Island City, and my apartment is right out of the Queens Plaza station.
