			2. User Research
		</p><br><br><br>
		<p class="mnrnr">- High frequency of using Apple Pay.<br>
	Some people use it 7-10 times a day.
	<br><br>
	- Most people use credit cards, but those<br>
	who use debit cards point out the following<br>
	problems:
	<br>a) The function is too simple. 
	<br>b) Users have to go to third party app to <br>check balance..
	<br>c) Users cannot transfer money within the <br>Apple Pay.
	<br><br>
	- Credit cards/Apple Cards users are pretty<br>
	satisfied on the features that already had on
	Apple Pay.
